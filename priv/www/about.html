    <p>I know this is probably, hard, and you don't understand what is going on, but please bear with me. Francis is a character from the <a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/">Valve</a> game <a href="http://www.l4d.com/">Left 4 Dead</a>. He is a somewhat negative type, and is constantly telling you what he "hates" in the game as you are playing.</p>
    <p>If you don't know much about Left 4 Dead, here's a primer:</p>
      <object width="480" height="295"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Nbzyt79iSR0&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Nbzyt79iSR0&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="295"></embed></object>
      <p>Cliff notes - there are lots of zombies. There are 4 players who have to work together to shoot them all, and flee to the safety of a waiting rescue vehicle.</p>
      <p>Anyway, here's what it's like playing francis:</p>

      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I'm madlep, I run some other sites. Notably <a href="http://www.ubercharged.net">ubercharged.net</a> (for Team Fortress 2) and <a href="http://boomercharged.net">boomercharged.net</a> (for Left 4 Dead). I was bored over the holidays, and wanted to play around with <a href="http://erlang.org/">Erlang</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mochiweb/">mochiweb</a>, and this was the result. If you hate what is going on here, grab the code from <a href="http://github.com/madlep/ihatevans/tree/master">github</a>, and do better!</p>
      <p>Hope that clears a few things up.</p>
      
      <h2>Credits</h2>
      <p>Thanks to Valve for creating such a great game, with great characters like francis. They also did the van image at the top. You can <a href="http://store.valvesoftware.com/productshowcase/productshowcase_L4D-IHateVansShirt.html">buy it on a t-shirt from their store</a>.</p>
      <p>Inspired by <a href="http://ohmyscience.org/">oh my science</a>, which was in turn inspired by a bunch of other sites including <a href="http://twistori.com/#i_hate">twistori</a>, which is the same as ihatevans.com except better, and more original.</p>
      <p>Thanks to all the ubercharged and boomercharged regulars that put up with my negligence in running the sites, yet still keep coming back.</p>
